## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-04

First public release.

### Added
- Core pipeline: YouTube livestream → download → transcribe → AI-proposed
  cuts → review/approve → metadata/thumbnails → export for YouTube.
- Layered final-render pipeline: cinematic grade via Intel QSV (FFmpeg) →
  selective transparent overlays (Remotion) → single-pass composition/encode.
- Segmented grade rendering in a memory-safe subprocess with freed threads (D-065).
- Per-cut and per-segment fine audio sync (offset) with live preview (F-063).
- Waveform/proxy warmup when a project is opened (F-062).
- Thumbnail prompt evaluation history to drive visual variation (D-066).
- Metadata access from the T / image icons in the cuts sidebar (D-068).
- "Not published" filter on the projects screen (F-059).
- Manual cut creation and YouTube URL parsing for manual publishing.
- Local image bank fallback for biography cards when the API has no match.

### Changed
- Render layered pipeline now runs the Remotion bundle in parallel with the
  GPU grade step, with a job-category worker queue.
- Skill routing reorganized by scope under `.guia/` (D-073).
- Process layout migrated to `.guia/`; the legacy `ai-process` pack was removed.

### Fixed
- Thumbnail headline no longer clips the title text (D-074).
- Exponential backoff for Claude CLI `529 Overloaded` responses (D-072).
- Cut generation uses the signed-in Claude session instead of the API key (D-071).
- Overlay chunks now use chunk-relative timing, fixing delayed/blank `.webm`
  chunks (see `docs/CHANGELOG.md` §8).
- Single-flight audio proxy with hybrid seek (I-039).
